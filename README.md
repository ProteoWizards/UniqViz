HUMAN UNIQUENESS MAP

We are exploring genes that are unique for human species and create a robust 1d visualisation tool for GO analysis.

Our tool is used in a very specific context in this example but we can in principle apply this to anyexperiments that characteriyes genes with a quantitative value(e.g. DE gene analysis)
